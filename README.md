# CSI281 Assignment 12

For this assignment, you will be implementing a priority queue backed by a binary max-heap. The tests will ensure that your priority queue works correctly and its pop() outperforms the standard library's equivalent functions for vector (finding the max element with a linear search and erasing it). You will also see an SVG chart generated with this comparison.

This assignment is heavily modeled on the pseudocode from Chapter 6 of Introduction to Algorithms. Please use the pseudocode as your reference. The one tweak we are making, is our binary heap starts at index 0, wheras the binary heap in the chapter started at index 1. Macros for parent(), left(), and right() are provided.

NOTE: For this assignment you are not allowed to add additional functions to the source files (even utility functions). Please just fill-in the provided function templates.

## Basic Instructions

1. Create your own **private** repository from this repo by hitting the "Use this template" button at the top of the page
2. Add me (@davecom) as a collaborator on your **private** repository.
3. Implement the missing parts where it says "YOUR CODE HERE"
4. Test it on your local computer by following the build directions below
5. Push your code to GitHub. Every push will be automatically tested on both Windows (MSVC) and Linux (GCC) through a GitHub Action. You will know your code is correct when you see a green check mark next to the commit.
6. Submit the URL to your private repository on Canvas. Submit even if you are not passing all tests so you can get partial credit.

## Standard Library Restrictions

All of the standard library is available to you except for the standard library's own priority queue.

## Directory Structure and Files

- `/` Main directory including this `README.md`, the build scripts, and will have the generated SVG search chart.
- `/lib` Libraries for drawing the charts and testing your work. There's no need to touch this.
- `/src` Source files, some of which you should modify and some of which you should not.

### Specific Files

*indicates do not modify
&indicates you must modify

- `CMakeLists.txt`* CMake "how to build" file
- `README.md`* this file
- `LICENSE` MIT License

- `lib/catch.h`* a unit testing library
- `lib/PPlot.cpp`* part of a chart making library
- `lib/PPlot.h`* part of a chart making library
- `lib/SVGPainter.cpp`* part of a chart making library
- `lib/SVGPainter.h`* part of a chart making library

- `src/PriorityQueue.h`& the PriorityQueue class you need to finish implementing
- `src/timing.h`* a function to help compare PriorityQueue.pop() with vector equivalents
- `src/main.cpp` the main file that runs the tests and makes the charts
- `src/test.cpp`* the unit tests to prove your code works

## Building and Running

You can use the command-line CMake tools if you are familiar with them. If you're not, you may find it easier to use one of these IDEs:

### CLion

Open the main directory of your repository (File -> Open). CLion should automatically detect it as a CMake project and allow you to press the run button (right-facing triangle like a play button) to execute the tests.

### Visual Studio

You'll need the "Desktop development with C++" workload installed including the "C++ CMake tools for Windows" (most installs have this). From the Visual Studio home screen select the option to "Open a local folder" and point the open dialog to your repository's main directory. Visual Studio should automatically detect your CMake project and allow you to build and debug it. You find more information in [Microsoft's CMake help documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio?view=msvc-170).
